##The Impact of Executive Functioning Deficit on Illness Severity in Patients With an ADHD Diagnosis: A Real-World Data Study

Lead author for this research article!

Executive functioning (EF) is a multifaceted neuropsychological construct that allows individuals to engage in goal-directed and novel problem-solving behaviors. 
EF deficits have been identified in a subgroup of patients with ADHD. Heterogeneity in peer, family, and academic functioning among individuals with ADHD has been 
related to EF performance. Electronic health record (EHR) data captures the presentation of patients with ADHD in a real-world clinical setting and is therefore well 
suited to study the impact of EF deficits on ADHD illness severity. This study aims to examine the differences between baseline Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) 
scores of patients with ADHD EF deficits compared with patients with ADHD without EF deficits.
